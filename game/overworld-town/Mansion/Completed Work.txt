Completed:
Basic Mansion Navigation
	Mansion Movement Event Framework
	Mansion Movement Flavor Text Framework

Basic Chore Systems
	I've completed the first pass on these events:
	laundry
	Garden
	Dungeon
	Main Hall
	Library 

Dungeon Punishment
	I've completed the first pass on this event:
	Vibrators for camera (only female PC, and the guards are all men right now)
	

Daily Events:
	I have written the event for the Pose For Painting daily event but have not finished putting it in code.

Guest rooms:
	I am playing around with some ideas, but the current code is a mess because of it.

No idea how to:
Clickable map
Sleep system

I know that I have calls to widgets like <<ggstress>> without actually increasing the stress, I'm working on it.
I might have been doing things wrong with <<generate1>> and <<endevent>> at some points.


If anyone wants to help, feel free to go over what I've written and give feedback/find mispellings. There will certaily be some of those. 
Or, if somebody wants to expand on an event or write a chore event, that would be apreceated too. Adding a chore event shouldn't be too hard. My goal for each chore event is to have sub events where the player can interact with each of a guard, guest or another servant while doing each chore.

Super tldr: The player is in a mansion doing work, possibly against their will. They are given a list of chores to do each day. Chores are things like cleaning a room or . There are events like serving or cooking dinner, one happens each day. There are rare events like a servant escaping that will happen some mornings.

The file structure of the mod is simple and I've compartmentalized everything pretty well, so it should be easy to work with it. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.
