	A small desk table in the middle of a small room with a man sitting on the other side of it. There are a number of doors exiting the room, but you doubt that youâ€™d be allowed entry. There is no chair for anyone on this side of the desk, forcing you to stand if you wish to talk with the person at the desk. A guard watches you unblinkingly, and cameras cover every inch of the room.
