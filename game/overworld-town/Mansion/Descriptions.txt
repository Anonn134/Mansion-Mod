# General Overview
There is a mansion in the woods about halfway between the lake and the town. The mansion is a sort of clubhouse where guests/club members go to relax and live for a while away from prying eyes.

The player is able to work there for money by signing a contract, or may be sent there by Bailey. If a contract is signed, the player determines how long they will be working at the mansion (longer = better pay rate), however you will not be allowed to leave before your contract is up.

There are three groups within the mansion, the mansion staff, the guests, and the servants. Each has its own “popularity” stat. More information can be found under *Popularity Stats*

Each day, the player is assigned a number of chores. The goal of the player is to complete these chores before the day ends. These chores are anything from cleaning specific rooms to cooking, to servicing guests. A few events will be locked by time and have to be done before a specific time. IE, the player cannot visit a guest after 1am if that is a chore. The list of chores can be seen under *Chore List*

In addition to these chores, each day the player will be given one daily task to perform at a specified time. Most days this is cooking but there are other events as well. These events can be found under *Daily Events*

Finally, on some mornings, a special event will fire. These events will have drastic changes on how that day professes. These events can be found under Morning Events

If the player misses a chore or task, they will be punished and get -mansion trust. Then depending on their overall mansion trust, they will be punished in a number of ways ranging from being forced into the dungeon or having their clothes privileges revoked. Missing chores or tasks also deducts from the pay the player will receive at the end of their contract. If that number goes to 0, they will not be allowed to leave even after the contract ends. The list of punishments can be found under *Punishments*

Once a player completes their list of chores for the day, they will have free time. The list of free time activities can be found under *Free Time Activities*

There are a number of ways for the player to escape the mansion. These ways can be found under *Escape Routes*

## Morning Events
On some mornings, an event will fire that does not have to do with chores or the daily event. These events have a drastic effect on how the day will progress.

- Escapee: Another servant has escaped, if you have high trust, you may be asked to help find them (new option added to each menu within quest widget). If you find them and turn them in, you will gain max trust. If you find them and don’t, they will tell you how to escape. Or you could just ignore them.

- Know your place: If the player gets too comfortable by having too much free time, they are reminded of where they are and what they are in an unsavory way. You are sufficiently traumatized, lose all sense of control and your daily tasks increase by 1 (system of dynamic difficulty)

- Player is rented out, yacht: An especially rich guest has “rented out” the player for a couple of days, you will be spending a lot of time with them on their yacht. 

- Player is rented out, room: A wealthy guest has requested, and paid a large sum, to have you visit their room at least once a day. Not doing so will anger the guest and the player will be punished until 7pm the next day and be sent off to the guests room with no chores.

## Daily Events
Each weekday there will be an activity for the player to take part in at night. M/W/F that activity will be cooking. The activity will start at 7, unless otherwise stated, and last an hour. 
- Cook for dinner: The default daily activity. The player will cook food for the guests, choosing from a list of three food choices for the three courses of the meal. The player will be told how well the guests like the meal overall, and will have to guess at what choices they made that were correct. Each week the correct meal choices change. The player may be able to get info about the meals from overheard conversation after the first day of dinner, once per day. Or from talking with the guests while in their room.

- Masquerade ball: All the guests wear masks and get much more aggressive thanks to their anonymity. The servants must wait on the guests and provide food and drink. Gets more dangerous as the night goes on. Different rooms become more populated and more dangerous as the night goes on, forcing the player to move between rooms while working. They might meet Avery here, who might be willing to save you from the mansion.

- Garden Maze game: The player must attempt to run and hide from hunters, you are given a small head start to hide in the hedge maze. Don’t get caught. The maze is random, however going the right direction when coming to landmarks is how to advance in the maze. If the player hides well enough, they may be able to slip away.

- Dinner Party: 
The player is told to be a hostess for a dinner party, the player needs to wait on guests who might want a taste of something more than food.
  - You might be able to slip something into drinks, causing a panic that allows you free reign of the mansion for a short time.
  - You may be able to regulate the amount of drinking guests do.
  - After some parties (cumulative random chance, at most every other), the servants will be lined up and guests will pair off. If a guest is sufficiently drunk, they might just go right to sleep after picking you, letting you leave the room in peace. If the pair off does not happen, drunk guests can be dangerous.

- Mud Wrestling: While cliche, some members enjoy seeing two servants duke it out in the mud. Winner gets to be cleaned off, the loser gets mobbed. This event would happen in the day.

- Be a dancer in the club: Self explanatory

## Free Time Activities

## Guest Rooms
Often the player will have the chore of visiting a guest in their room ot service them. While in the room, they are expected to stay until the guest gives them permission to leave. While in the room, the guest anger, trust, etc will be persistant. Guests may keep the player in their room for a very long time (but never longer than a day), preventing the from doing other chores. To avoid getting in trouble, players can ask for the guest to get the player excused from their chores. Players may do a number of things while in a guest room:
- Ask to leave
- Ask for excuse note
- Talk with guest
- Take a bath
- Sleep in guest bed
- Sleep on floor

### Guest Room Descriptions
Guest rooms will have multiple different layouts, some layouts have an effect on what can happen to the player and what the guest does.

- The room is clean and well kept, a bed sits in the corner and across from a TV. 
- This room is cluttered, but otherwise clean. It looks like this guest has lived here for a while, with some personal effects strewn about on various tables.
- This room is more barren than others you’ve seen, there is just a single bed in the center of the room and nothing else.
- Entering this room, you get a shiver down your spine. Chains dangle from the ceiling, and a small metal loop sits underneath it. There is a small bed in the corner. The guest pushes you in and shuts the door behind you.
- This room seems normal enough, a bed sits in the usual corner and there is a small table on the other side of the room. As you walk further in, your heart drops as you think you see small specks of something red on the wall near the bed.

### Guest Quirks
When the player enters a room, the guest will be assigned a list of quirks that interact with what the player is doing, and the guest will say and do different things depending on those quirks.
- Wants a specific act preformed
- Wants the player to leave immediately
- Refuses to let the player leave, but will sign an excuse note if the player doesn’t push it
- Refuses to let the player clean themselves
- Doesn’t want the player to make a sound
- Silent guest hurts the player when they talk
- Stops before player cums, gets angry when player does. 
- Uses toys during sex.
- Chokes or beats the player, player passes out after encounter. Wakes up in same guest room. Maybe alone, maybe tied up, maybe with toys.
- Leaves the player alone in the room, maybe tied up, maybe with toys.
