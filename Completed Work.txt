Completed:
Basic Mansion Navigation
Framework for events happening when moving between rooms
Framework for flavor text when moving between rooms. Some flavortext has been written already.

Basic Chore System
I've completed the first pass on the chore events for these rooms:
	laundry
	Garden
	Dungeon
	Main Hall
	Library 

Dungeon Punishment Main Loop
I've completed the first pass on this event:
	Vibrators for camera (only female PC, and the guards are all men right now)
	
Daily Events:
	I have written the event for the Pose For Painting daily event but have not finished putting it in code.

Guest rooms:
	I am playing around with some ideas, but the current code is a mess because of it.

No idea how to:
Clickable map
Sleep system
Initialize new variables in an old save

I know that I have calls to widgets like <<ggstress>> without actually increasing the stress, I'm working on it.
I might have been doing things wrong with <<generate1>> and <<endevent>> at some points, but now I know how all that works, I think.

The file structure of the mod is simple and I've compartmentalized everything pretty well, so it should be easy to work with it. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.
